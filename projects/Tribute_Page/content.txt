Bhagat Singh, a prominent figure in India's struggle for independence, was born on September 28, 1907, in a small village called Banga in the Punjab province of British India (now in Pakistan). He played a crucial role in the fight against British colonial rule and is remembered as one of the most influential and iconic freedom fighters in India's history. Here is a brief biography of the life of Bhagat Singh:

Early Life and Influences:
Bhagat Singh was born into a family with a history of political activism. His father, Kishan Singh Sandhu, and his uncles were actively involved in the Indian independence movement. From an early age, Bhagat Singh was exposed to the ideas of patriotism, nationalism, and the desire for India's freedom.

Influence of Jallianwala Bagh Massacre:
The Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in 1919 had a profound impact on Bhagat Singh. Witnessing the brutal and indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians by British troops in Amritsar left a lasting impression on his young mind and fueled his determination to fight against British oppression.

Joining the Freedom Movement:
As a young man, Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), a revolutionary organization committed to overthrowing British rule through armed struggle. He was deeply inspired by the works of prominent revolutionaries like Chandrashekhar Azad and Ram Prasad Bismil.

Assassination of J.P. Saunders:
On December 17, 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai, another prominent freedom fighter, led a protest against the Simon Commission, a British-appointed committee that did not have any Indian representation. The police responded with brutal force, and during the lathi charge, Lala Lajpat Rai was severely injured and later died. Seeking revenge for the death of their leader, the HSRA decided to assassinate James A. Saunders, the police officer they held responsible for the lathi charge.

Assembly Bombing:
In an unfortunate case of mistaken identity, Bhagat Singh and his associates threw non-lethal bombs inside the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi on April 8, 1929. The aim was to protest against the repressive Public Safety Bill and the Trade Disputes Act. The intention was not to cause harm but to use the trial as a platform to showcase their revolutionary ideas.

Arrest and Trial:
Bhagat Singh, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, was arrested after the Assembly bombing. During the trial, they used the courtroom to propagate their nationalist and revolutionary ideals. Bhagat Singh famously stated, "It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas."

Martyrdom:
Despite a massive public outcry for clemency, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev were sentenced to death. On March 23, 1931, they were hanged in the Lahore Central Jail. Their sacrifice sparked a wave of protests across India and intensified the demand for independence.

Legacy:
Bhagat Singh's bravery, patriotism, and dedication to the cause of freedom continue to inspire generations of Indians. He is remembered as a symbol of courage and selflessness in the struggle against injustice and tyranny. March 23, the day of his execution, is observed as Shaheed Diwas (Martyrs' Day) in India, paying tribute to all those who sacrificed their lives for the country.

Bhagat Singh's life and sacrifice serve as a reminder of the indomitable spirit of the Indian freedom movement and the relentless pursuit of liberty and justice. His legacy lives on in the hearts of millions who cherish the dream of a free and independent India.

page - 3 -------------------------------------> Chandrashekhar Azad --------------------->

Chandrashekhar Azad, often referred to as Azad, was a prominent Indian revolutionary and one of the most fearless freedom fighters during the Indian independence movement. He played a crucial role in challenging British rule and inspired a generation of young revolutionaries to join the struggle for India's freedom. Here are the key aspects of Chandrashekhar Azad's life:

Early Life:
Chandrashekhar Azad was born as Chandrashekhar Tiwari on July 23, 1906, in Bhavra village in present-day Madhya Pradesh, India. He was deeply influenced by the stories of valor and sacrifice of historical Indian figures, which instilled a strong sense of nationalism in him from an early age.

Entry into the Freedom Movement:
Azad joined the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi at a young age. However, he soon became disillusioned with its non-violent approach after witnessing the brutal Jallianwala Bagh Massacre in 1919 and the Chauri Chaura incident in 1922 when a peaceful protest turned violent. He believed that non-violence alone would not be enough to drive the British out of India.

Formation of the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA):
In 1928, along with fellow revolutionaries Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev, and others, Chandrashekhar Azad formed the HSRA. The organization aimed to overthrow British rule and establish an independent and socialist India. Azad played a pivotal role in organizing revolutionary activities and spreading the message of armed resistance.

Acts of Resistance:
Azad participated in several acts of resistance against the British government. He was involved in the Central Legislative Assembly bombing in Delhi on April 8, 1929, along with Bhagat Singh to protest against repressive laws. He managed to escape the police after the incident, leading to his famous declaration, "You will never capture me alive."

Encounter in Alfred Park (Now Chandrashekhar Azad Park):
On February 27, 1931, Chandrashekhar Azad was surrounded by British police in Alfred Park, Allahabad. He fought bravely and held off the police to allow his comrades to escape. In the end, unwilling to be captured alive, he shot himself to avoid arrest and chose death over surrender.

Legacy:
Chandrashekhar Azad's fearless commitment to the cause of independence and his determination to resist British oppression earned him the title of "Azad," meaning "free" or "independent." He remains a symbol of bravery and valor in the annals of Indian history.

Commemoration:
Several places in India have been named in his honor, such as the Chandrashekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology in Kanpur and the Chandrashekhar Azad Park in Allahabad. His memory continues to inspire generations of Indians to uphold the values of freedom, justice, and sacrifice.

Chandrashekhar Azad's unwavering dedication to the cause of India's independence, his resolve to take up arms against the British, and his ultimate sacrifice have immortalized him as one of the most revered and admired heroes of the Indian freedom movement.
